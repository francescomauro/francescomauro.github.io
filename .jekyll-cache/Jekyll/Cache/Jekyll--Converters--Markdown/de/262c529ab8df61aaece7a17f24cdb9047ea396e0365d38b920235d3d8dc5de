I"ƒ<p>Cyberbullying means using technology to harass, threaten, embarrass or target another 
person, and by definition it happens among young people. When it happens to adults over 18, 
it takes the name of cyberharassment or cyberstalking, and is a crime with serious legal 
consequences. How can you recognise cyberbullying? Sometimes the writer of a message is 
being friendly and joking but the person who receives it misunderstands the tone. So an 
argument starts. This is not cyberbullying. When there is a repeated pattern and the messages 
continue with no provocation, or the person ignores requests to stop, this is cyberbullying.</p>
